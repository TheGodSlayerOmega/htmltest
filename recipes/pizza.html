        <h1>ingredients:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball of pizza dough (00 tipo flour, salt and water)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup pizza sauce (tomato sauce, salt, pepper, oregano and parsley)</li>
            <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about ¾ cup shredded mozzarella)</li>
            <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
            <li>2 basil leaves</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dough</li>
            
            <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven</li>
            
            <li>Make the pizza sauce</li>

            <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. 
                <br>If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), 
                <br>you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes 
                <br>then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li>
            <li>When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle. 
                <br>Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top. 
                <br>Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese. 
                <br>Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add a few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake until the cheese is melted, 
                <br>about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
